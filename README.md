# Talking myself into the value of acceptance testing

This is the source for a talk I gave at [Melbourne CocoaHeads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/) on 18/06/2015.

You can look at the slides from the browser [here](https://mokagio.github.io/acceptance-tests-cocoaheads-talk). Best view on Firefox or Safari, _at the time of writing Chrome still has issues with emojis_, in a square-ish window, because of some of the gifs in the background.

The slides are made with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) which is a pretty cool project. Plus some hacking of top of it for the background opacity and to use [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

If you're interested in the topic don't hesitate to tweet me [@mokagio](https://twitter.com/mokagio), or visit [mokacoding.com](http://mokacoding.com) where I've done some more writing about it.

Cheers!
